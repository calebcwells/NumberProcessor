1. **NumberProcessor.Core**: Contains the core logic for processing and formatting numbers.
2. **NumberProcessor.Web**: A Blazor WebAssembly application that provides a web interface for the number processor.
3. **NumberProcessor.Console**: A console application that allows users to input a number and see the processed result.
4. **NumberProcessor.Tests**: Unit tests for the core logic using xUnit and Bunit.

## Features

- **Number Formatting**: Formats numbers based on specific rules (e.g., multiples of 3 are replaced with "Caleb", multiples of 5 with "Wells", and multiples of both with "Caleb Wells").
- **Web Interface**: A Blazor WebAssembly application that allows users to input a number and see the processed result.
- **Console Interface**: A console application that allows users to input a number and see the processed result.
